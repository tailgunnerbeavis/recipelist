Recipe List using Redux/React
=============================================

* Display a list (or table) of recipes.
* Allow filtering of recipes by a single ingredient.
* Add checkboxes to allow selection of multiple recipes.
* Show an alphabetically ordered list of distinct ingredients for the selected recipes. This should update as recipes are selected / unselected.
* Persist the selections locally and regenerate the view on page refresh.

=============================================
